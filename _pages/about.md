I am an incoming Ph.D. student at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I will be joining the [Robotics and Machine Intelligence (ROMI) Lab](https://www.romi-lab.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. David Navarro-Alarcon](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/david-navarro-alarcon-prof/).

Previously, I received my M.Eng. degree in 2025 from the School of Intelligent Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, where I was advised by [Prof. Jianqing Peng](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianqing-Peng-3). I also obtained my B.Eng. degree in 2022 from the same institution.

My research interests lie at the intersection of robotic autonomy, vision-language modeling, and medical image understanding, particularly in the context of robot-assisted surgery.
