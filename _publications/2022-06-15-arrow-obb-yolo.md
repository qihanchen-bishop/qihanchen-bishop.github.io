In this paper, we present a novel Arrow Object Bounding Box (OBB)-YOLO network for the autonomous recognition of multiple surgical instrument tips in laparoscopic scenes. The method not only detects and localizes surgical tools but also explicitly encodes critical directional informationâ€”such as tip orientationâ€”through arrow annotations, all while meeting real-time processing requirements in clinical scenarios.

### Highlights

- **Arrow OBB representation**: A new bounding box model that includes directional arrows, enabling enhanced interpretation of instrument tip angles. This is solved through coordinate transformation and arrow error optimization.
- **Two-phase training**: A stepwise optimization strategy that splits the training into BB detection and arrow refinement stages, accelerating convergence and improving stability.
- **Public dataset**: We publish a high-resolution dataset of surgical instruments across diverse categories and scenes, designed for benchmarking real-world tool recognition tasks in surgery.
