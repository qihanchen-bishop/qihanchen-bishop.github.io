In this paper, we present a novel Arrow Object Bounding Box (OBB)-YOLO network for the autonomous recognition of multiple surgical instrument tips in laparoscopic scenes. The method not only detects and localizes surgical tools but also explicitly encodes critical directional information—such as tip orientation—through arrow annotations, all while meeting real-time processing requirements in clinical scenarios.
