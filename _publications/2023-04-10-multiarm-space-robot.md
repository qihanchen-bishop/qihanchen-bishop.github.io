### Highlights

- **Closed-chain kinematics and dynamics modeling**: The authors derive general formulations describing the kinematic and dynamic behavior of multi-arm continuous robots interacting with a target object in space, based on the closed-chain constraints.
- **Two-phase cooperative planning**: For the pre-capture stage, null-space solutions under joint constraints are explored to plan feasible cable parameters. For the post-capture stage, nonlinear optimization is used to minimize base disturbance during manipulation.
- **Compliant hybrid control**: A novel control strategy combining force and pose objectives is introduced to optimize internal force distribution and minimize cable tension after capture.
- **Co-simulation validation**: The proposed method is verified using a co-simulation platform built with MATLAB and SimMechanics, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in various manipulation scenarios.
