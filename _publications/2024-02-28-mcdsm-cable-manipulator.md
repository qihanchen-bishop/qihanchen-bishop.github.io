In this paper, we propose a modular cable-driven snake-like manipulator (MCDSM) aimed at safe and dexterous operation in narrow and unstructured environments. The modular design allows for flexible adaptation to multiple tasks, while impedance-based compliance control improves human-robot interaction performance.

### Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Detachable arm segments and plug-in drive units enhance reconfigurability, rapid assembly, and maintainability.
- **Self-Calibration**: A redundant cable length-based method is developed to self-calibrate cable-to-joint mapping, considering torsional deformation.
- **Tension Optimization**: A dynamic joint-space model is used to decouple cable tension control via an optimization strategy, improving response and robustness.
- **Compliance Control**: An inner-loop cable tension control is integrated into an impedance framework, ensuring safe interaction and load-bearing capabilities.
- **Experimental Validation**: Both simulations and physical prototype experiments validate the proposed models and controllers.
