In this paper, we propose a modular cable-driven snake-like manipulator (MCDSM) aimed at safe and dexterous operation in narrow and unstructured environments. The modular design allows for flexible adaptation to multiple tasks, while impedance-based compliance control improves human-robot interaction performance.
