title: "Design and Control of a Cable-driven Snake-like Robot (Robot Design and Control)"
duration: Sep 2022 - Sep 2023
field: "Robotics, Control Systems"
status: "Completed"
summary: "Development of modular snake-like robot with dynamic modeling and impedance control."
contributions:
 - Participate in robot design, through the key components of the modular convenient robot quick installation and maintenance.
 - Establish a kinematic model, through the motor drive screw rail module to achieve cable length control, to achieve end position control, and through the redundant cable to achieve robot self-calibration.
 - Through the Newton-Euler method complete the dynamic modeling and realize the robot impedance control.
