**Duration:** Sep 2022 - Sep 2023  
**Field:** Robotics, Control Systems

### Main Contributions:
1. Participate in robot design, through the key components of the modular convenient robot quick installation and maintenance.  
2. Establish a kinematic model, through the motor drive screw rail module to achieve cable length control, to achieve end position control, and through the redundant cable to achieve robot self-calibration.  
3. Through the Newton-Euler method complete the dynamic modeling and realize the robot impedance control.
