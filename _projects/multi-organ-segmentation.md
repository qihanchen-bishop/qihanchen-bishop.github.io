**Duration:** Sep 2023 - Dec 2024  
**Field:** Medical Imaging, Computer Vision

### Main Contributions:
1. Through the totalsegmentor data set screening and cleaning, to meet the puncture surgery needs of high-quality data sets.  
2. Based on the nnUNet framework, the multi-organ segmentation model is obtained, and through multi-stage training gradually improves the model in each organ performance.  
3. Through QT and VTK in Linux to build the organ 3D reconstruction software platform.
