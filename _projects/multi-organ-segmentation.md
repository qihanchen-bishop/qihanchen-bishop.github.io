title: "Medical Company Cooperation Project: Multi-organ Segmentation and 3D Reconstruction of CT Images (3D Segmentation and Reconstruction)"
field: "Medical Imaging, Computer Vision"
status: "Completed"
summary: "Multi-organ segmentation and 3D reconstruction software platform development for CT images."
duration: Sep 2023 - Dec 2024  
contributions:
- Through the totalsegmentor data set screening and cleaning, to meet the puncture surgery needs of high-quality data sets.  
- Based on the nnUNet framework, the multi-organ segmentation model is obtained, and through multi-stage training gradually improves the model in each organ performance.  
- Through QT and VTK in Linux to build the organ 3D reconstruction software platform.
