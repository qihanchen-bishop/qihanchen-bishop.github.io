**Duration:** May 2022 - Sep 2022  
**Field:** Medical Imaging, AI

### Main Contributions:
1. Unet was used to complete the preliminary classification of retinal arteriovenous in fundus color images.  
2. The topological graph method is used to correct the results of deep learning classification to solve the problem of the lack of topological continuity.  
3. Considering the lack of relevant review papers, a comprehensive summary of the retinal arteriovenous automatic classification method is completed through literature research and data statistics.
