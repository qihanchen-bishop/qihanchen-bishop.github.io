title: "Summer AI Internship Project - Retinal Arteriovenous Classification (Semantic Segmentation)"
field: "Medical Imaging, AI"
status: "Completed"
summary: "Retinal arteriovenous classification using deep learning and topological graph correction."
duration: May 2022 - Sep 2022  
contributions:
- Unet was used to complete the preliminary classification of retinal arteriovenous in fundus color images.  
- The topological graph method is used to correct the results of deep learning classification to solve the problem of the lack of topological continuity.  
- Considering the lack of relevant review papers, a comprehensive summary of the retinal arteriovenous automatic classification method is completed through literature research and data statistics.
